# The C-Tanist Virtual Machine
[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
Our virtual machine (and future complete assembly suite) is here! Its called `pentacle`:

## How to compile:

```bash
$ meson setup build
$ ninja -C build
```

## Dependencies
You need to have installed and properly configured on your machine:

- `meson`
- `ninja`
- `python`
- a compatible `c`/`c++` compiler

`meson` should handle all other dependencies for you. 

If you're on `Linux` or another *POSIX*-compliant OS, use your package manager of choice.

If your're on `Windows`, you can try the [bundled MSI installer](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/releases/download/1.8.1/meson-1.8.1-64.msi).

In case of doubt, refer to the [meson installation manual](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html)
